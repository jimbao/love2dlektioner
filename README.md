Love 2d lessons in Swedish

I'm not a teacher or a professional game programmer, please contribute to improve these lessons.

Intended audience is students who are done with Scratch and want to try something a bit more difficult. If these lessons are too hard I recommend working more with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/).

If these lessons are too easy I recommend taking a look at [Unity](http://unity3d.com/).
